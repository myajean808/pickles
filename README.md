INT. BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

EDGAR
Mark?

MARK doesn't look up from his computer--

EDGAR (CONT'D)
Mark.

MARK still doesn't look up--

SEAN
He's wired in.

EDGAR
(pause)
I'm sorry?

SEAN
He's wired in.

EDGAR
Is he?

SEAN
Yes.

EDGAR picks up MARK's laptop over his head and smashes it
down on the desk, breaking it into pieces.

EDGAR
How 'bout now, are you still wired in?

SEAN
(to the girl at the desk he's
leaning against)
Call security.

Everyone in the office is frozen, silent and watching.

EDGAR
You issued over 24-million new shares of
stock.

MARK
You were told that if new investors came
along--

EDGAR
How much were your shares diluted? How
much were his?!

CUT TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - EVENING

GRETCHEN
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's ownership share
diluted down to?

EDGAR
It wasn't.

GRETCHEN
What was Mr. Moskovitz's ownership share
diluted down to?

EDGAR
It wasn't.

GRETCHEN
What was Sean Parker's ownership share
diluted down to?

EDGAR
It wasn't.

GRETCHEN
What was Peter Thiel's ownership share
diluted down to?

EDGAR
It wasn't.

GRETCHEN
What was your ownership share diluted
down to?

EDGAR
(pause)
Point-zero-three percent.

CUT TO:
INT. NEW FACEBOOK OFFICES - NIGHT

MARK
You signed the papers.

EDGAR
You set me up.

MARK
You're gonna blame me because you were
the business head of the company and you
made a bad business deal with your own
company?!

EDGAR
It's gonna be like I'm not part of
Facebook.

SEAN
It's won't be like you're not part of
Facebook, you're not part of Facebook.

EDGAR
My name's on the masthead.

SEAN
You might wanna check again.

EDGAR is momentarily frozen...

EDGAR
This is because I froze the account?

SEAN
You think we were gonna let you parade
around in your ridiculous suits
pretending you were running this company?

EDGAR
Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaners along
with my hoodie and my fuck-you flip-flops
you pretentious douchebag.

SEAN
Security's here. You'll be leaving now.
Two SECURITY GUARDS have come in--

EDGAR
I'm not signing those papers.

SEAN
We'll get the signature.

EDGAR
(turning to MARK)
Tell me this isn't about me getting into the Phoenix!

(pause)

EDGAR (CONT'D)
You did it. I always knew you did it. You
planted the story about the chicken.

SEAN
(pause)
What is he talking about?

EDGAR
You had me accused--

SEAN
Seriously, what the hell's the chicken?

EDGAR
And I'll bet what you hated the most is
that they identified me as a co-founder of
Facebook--which I am! You better lawyerup,
asshole, 'cause I'm not comin' back
for my 30 percent, I'm comin' back for
everything!

SEAN
(to SECURITY)
Get him outa here.

EDGAR
I'm going.

SEAN
Hang on.

SEAN hands EDGAR a folded check.

SEAN (CONT'D)
I almost forgot, there's your $19,000. I
wouldn't cash it, though, I drew it on
the account you froze.

EDGAR looks at SEAN...then suddenly and quickly cocks his
fist back to punch him in the face. SEAN flinches as EDGAR
holds his punch and lets out a small laugh.

EDGAR
I like standing next to you, Sean. It
makes me look so tough.

EDGAR exits with the security escort.
There's a long silence in the room...
